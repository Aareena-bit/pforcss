        <p>Hey there! I am Joe Thomson, a passionate web developer with a love for creating clean, functional, and user-friendly websites. With a strong foundation in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as experience with back-end development, I bring ideas to life by building responsive and dynamic web applications. I believe in the power of clean code and seamless user experiences, and I'm always excited to tackle new challenges and learn along the way. Whether you’re looking for a simple portfolio or a complex web application, I’m here to help bring your vision to the web!
